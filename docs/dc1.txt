   This is a open spezification of the neo-modus.com direct connect protocol.
   If you find here some errors, please write me a mail.
   This direct connect protocol spezifcations describe the client<->server and the
   server<->server commands. And a little bit the client<->client protocol.

   1.  Client-Server protocol

   direct connect uses TCP for client to server communication. The servers called "Hubs" runs
   on port 411.

   each message to/from the server is in the form of


   <command>|

   the | specifies the end of each command.
   each command starts with a $.

   if the packed starting without a $ then the packed is a public chat message.
   each public chat message is in the form of

   <<username>> <chattext>|


   the | specifies the end of each public chat message.

   2. Command Types (client to server)

   The following section describes the format of the Commands
   Each field is denoted with <>.  The fields in the command are separated
   by a single space character (ASCII 32). And each Command ends with a | (pipe)
   All Commands are casesensetiv

   //unknown

   //request shared listfilesize
   CL1: $GetListLen
   CL2: $ListLen <sizeinbyte>
   //request shared listfilesize

   //request the shared filelist
   CL1: $Get MyList.DcLst$1
   CL2: $FileLength <sizeinbytes>
   //request the shared filelist
