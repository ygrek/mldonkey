# MLDonkey: cross-platform multi-network peer-to-peer daemon

[![Build](https://github.com/ygrek/mldonkey/actions/workflows/workflow.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ygrek/mldonkey/actions/workflows/workflow.yml)

A lot of documentation (wiki) and user forums were previously hosted at http://mldonkey.sourceforge.net, but were shut down on August 21, 2023,
see [issue #90](https://github.com/ygrek/mldonkey/issues/90) for the details and links to the data dumps (help needed to restore them to the usable form).

[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ygrek/mldonkey/discussions) serves as a replacement for the forum for the time being.
