Common Mistakes
---------------

If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at http://www.troll.no
to get a copy of Qt, version 2.2.1 or newer.  If you have peeked there
already, grab the CVS module qt-copy from anoncvs.kde.org, or a snapshot
thereof.

Debugging
---------

You can use --enable-debug with the configure script, if you want to have
debug code in your KDE apps and libs.  I recommend to do this, since this
is alpha software and this makes debugging things a whole lot easier.

More Info
---------

Have a look at the individual subdirectories, if you want to know, what
versions of apps are included.
